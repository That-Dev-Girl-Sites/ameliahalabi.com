        <p>Wow… I start day care tomorrow. Mommy seems to be sad about that. Really we both had mixed feelings about this. I was not supposed to start day care for at least another month. (They originally said I couldn’t start until mid-December.) But, a spot opened up early for me, so here I go!</p>

        <p>However, today, Mommy and I spent the whole day together. It was a really pretty day out, so we went for a long walk up to Kingstowne. We shopped a little, then had lunch outside at Fiona’s. Well, Mommy had lunch. I watched and enjoyed the weather.</p>

        <p>After we got home, we had bath time, then I watched my first full movie with Mommy. We watched <i>Coco</i>. I really loved the music, but movies are long. I fell asleep in the middle of it. I guess that was a good thing. I’m going to have an exciting day tomorrow!</p>
