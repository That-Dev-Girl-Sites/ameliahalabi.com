        <p>Mommy and I spent a bunch of days in the hospital after I was born. So much happened. Mommy fed me from her breast a lot. We went to a feeding class. Nurses came into our room all the time to check on Mommy or me. I met some of Mommy’s friends when they came by to visit. The hospital is where I met Gussie, Yusef, and Sonya.</p>

        <p>I lost a bunch of weight in the hospital. They tell me that is normal, but I lost just a little too much so I have to go see the doctor right after we get home to make sure I am gaining enough weight back.</p>

        <p>Yusef helped to get us all home, because Mommy isn’t allowed to lift very much or drive yet.</p>
