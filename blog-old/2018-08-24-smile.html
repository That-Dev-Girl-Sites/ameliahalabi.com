        <p>I was super awake for a good chunk of the afternoon today. Mommy and I played for a while on my activity mat. I did tummy time for a little while, which I hated! <em>(I’ve never liked tummy time.)</em></p>

        <p>In order to cheer me up, Mommy started throwing me up into the air and yelling <em>“Wheeeee!”</em> Well, she didn’t throw me, technically, since she never let go of me. But it was still a lot of fun. So much fun, that I couldn’t help but to put a great big smile on my face. My first real smile, in fact. This made mommy <em>so</em> excited that she kept throwing me up into the air. She also went a little photo crazy. Did I mention she was <em>really</em> excited about my smile?</p>

        <p>The photo of my first smile is blurry, which made Mommy a little sad, but it’s ok because I still look amazing and happy in it.</p>
