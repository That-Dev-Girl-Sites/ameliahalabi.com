        <p>I am 2 months old today! Mommy and I have been celebrating with a very busy weekend.</p>

        <p>Yesterday, I went to my first birthday party! Marcus and Jacob turned 1 year old. I hadn’t met them yet, but Mommy is friends with their mommy and daddy. It was a fun party. There were lots of people there - including other babies! I was the youngest person at the party. I watched the other babies, but didn’t really say hi. The party was very loud, but I still managed to get a nap in during it!</p>

        <p>Today, I went to my first concert! Well, it was really a fundraiser for puppies, but Mommy’s friend Robbie was playing some of his songs, so she is counting this as my first concert. I listened to the first 2 songs, but then I wasn’t feeling too great, so I started crying and crying, and we didn’t hear the last 2 songs he played. But that’s OK. Mommy took care of me and we went home. I am much better now.</p>

        <p>Happy 2-month birthday to me! I’m pooped now! (Pun kind of intended.) </p>
