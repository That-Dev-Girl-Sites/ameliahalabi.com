        <p>I passed my 4-month checkup with flying colors yesterday, so much so that the doctor said I can start eating solid food! </p>

        <p>All I have to say to that is, <strong>it’s about time!</strong></p>

        <p>I see Mommy eat all the time and it looks amazing. I want some, but she’s never let me have what she’s having, or at least not much of it, until now.</p>

        <p>When I got home from day care today, Mommy had a surprise for me: a <strong>banana!</strong></p>

        <p>Ok, it did not look like an actual banana. It was all mushed up in a small dish. Mommy started to feed me with a spoon, and then her finger, and then back to the spoon. It didn’t matter. I wanted more. It was delicious!</p>
