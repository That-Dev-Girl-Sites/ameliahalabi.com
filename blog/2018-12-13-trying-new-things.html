        <p>I was sent home sick from day care yesterday, so I had to stay home today too. It was pretty fun, even though I was pretty cranky and tired.</p>

        <p>I really did not want to eat a whole lot, but Mommy had a surprise for me. I tried butternut squash for the first time today. I did not like it.</p>

        <p>But, in more exciting news, I was playing in my room before bed today and I sat up! All by myself! I fell over pretty quickly, but, for a couple of seconds,  I sat up!!</p>
