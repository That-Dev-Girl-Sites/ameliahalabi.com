Today was a big day for me. I got my belly button today! Mommy started to change me very early this morning when she saw that my umbilical cord fell off. She was very surprised, and the. She got really excited and - you guessed it - took her camera out.

My belly button is bothering me a little bit but Mommy is super excited that itâ€™s there, so I guess this is a good thing.
