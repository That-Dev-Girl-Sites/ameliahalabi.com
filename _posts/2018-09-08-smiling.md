Mommy discovered my deepest secret today. I am ticklish!

She is taking full advantage of this. I am mostly ticklish on my belly and my feet. I am not sure how I feel about this, but it does make me smile more. And this makes mommy smile more. This also makes her take more pictures of me. Sheâ€™s a little crazy with the camera. I really like messing with her when she goes camera crazy, but I did give her a couple of good smiles! <3

Also, just for giggles, I decided that one blanket just is not cutting it for me. I want _all_ the blankets!!
