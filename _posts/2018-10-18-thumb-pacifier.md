I just realized that it has been a while since I have written. I discovered something very exciting and new today… my thumb!

These past two and a half months, I have been really enjoying my pacifiers - Mr. Elephant and Sophie. To be honest, I still enjoy them, but they are not always around. I had been trying to suck my fist, but that doesn’t work so well.  _(I definitely need a bigger mouth.)_  

Today, I discovered something very important. If I stick my thumb from out of my fist, _I can suck my thumb!_

Mind. Blown.
