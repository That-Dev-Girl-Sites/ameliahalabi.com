_Happy 8-month birthday to me!_

I am 8 months old today! I can do so many more things now than I could a month ago.

I can roll all the way over - back to front and front to back... and back to front to back! I am trying really, really, really hard to crawl, but I'm not quite there yet.

My clothes are getting smaller on me and I'm starting to wear some of my 12-month clothes. I can wear sunglasses (and promptly try to eat them).

I can start chewing things with my gums. (No teeth yet!) I am drinking more water and even trying new foods. I love yogurt and I tolerate hummus.

I am saying more and more sounds. I love to shout. I say things like "aaah" and "oooh". I still say "ba ba" and "da da" a lot, but I am also saying "waa waa" and "t t". I blow raspberries and that makes me laugh a lot. And I absolutely love it when Mommy says any of these things with me.

But, most fun of all, is when Mommy tries to drum something on the side of my crib or on the table and I try to copy what she's doing. I don't really get it, but I am definitely trying to do what she does!
