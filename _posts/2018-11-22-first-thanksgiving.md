Today was my very first Thanksgiving! I got all dressed up and then Mommy and I went to Auntie Ferial’s house and I met a whole bunch of my aunts and uncles and cousins.

Everyone was very nice and curious about me, but they were all very loud. Aunt Claudia and Uncle Jerry held me. Teta gave me wine to try on her finger. (It wasn’t terrible.) Mommy gave me cranberry juice to try on her finger. (It also wasn’t terrible.)
