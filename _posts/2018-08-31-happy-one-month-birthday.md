_Happy 1-month birthday to me_

Can you guess what today is? Neither of us can believe that I have been alive for exactly one month. Mommy sang to me exactly at 1:40pm today. Mommy may or may not have teared up a little bit.

## Check up
I had my 1-month check up with the doctor today. So far, so good! I gained a bunch of weight and am now 8 lb 15 oz. I grew just a little taller too, but only 0.25 inches.

Mommy has done an amazing job at feeding me whenever I am hungry, which is super often. But, now the doctor says that I should only be eating about two-thirds of what I have been, so Mommy needs to cut back on my formula feedings. Which means… I’m going on a baby diet. Waaah!

Seriously, both of us are crying about this. I am super cranky about getting less food and Mommy is sad because I am sad. I think I’m starting to get used to the idea, but it’s taking a while.

## Brownies
Mommy baked brownies to celebrate my 1-month birthday. Some friends - Yusef, Corey, and Romel - came over to help celebrate and eat brownies… and of course to wish me a happy birthday.
