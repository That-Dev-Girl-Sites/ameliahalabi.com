I am growing super fast! Mommy is excited about this because it means I am a healthy “big” girl, but I think she also misses how little I was just a month ago.

I am still wearing my 0-3 month clothes, but I am pretty sure I will outgrow them soon. Finally, new clothes!

Mommy also added a new lamp to my room. It is a very old lamp - it was in Mommy’s room when she was a baby! I love it. It has a boy and a girl on it and a cat that you can spin around to make music.
