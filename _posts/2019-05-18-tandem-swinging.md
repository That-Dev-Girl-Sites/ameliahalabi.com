Mommy and I went out to brunch today, but afterwards, it was so nice out, that we went to a park in Springfield. There was a big nature walk that we took. We walked around a pond.

At one end of the pond, there was a _big_ playground. Most of the playground was for bigger kids, but there was a swing set in the playground. The swing set not only had baby swings, but _tandem_ baby swings! Mommy and I got to swing _at the same time!!!_ It was so much fun. I never want to leave that swing.
