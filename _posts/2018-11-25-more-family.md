We are still in New Jersey and I got to meet even _more_ of the family. _(Gee, this family is giant!)_

Auntie Najwa and Uncle Hani flew to New York from Lebanon, and they came to Tetaâ€™s house in New Jersey with Aunt Nadine and my cousin Mason. We spent the whole day together. We walked to the playground, but was wet, so no swinging or sliding for us. We ate. I slept. I played.  It was fun.
