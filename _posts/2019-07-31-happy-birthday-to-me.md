_Happy Birthday to me!_

_Happy Birthday dear Amelia!_
_Happy Birthday to me!_

I am officially 1 year old today! I know I have changed so much in this last year and I have had a lot of fun doing it. Mommy is so proud of how I have grown and she calls me the "best baby ever."

Well, really, she has giving me a lot of nicknames over the year: Sweet Pea. Baby Doll. Baby Girl. Kiddo. But I'm going to stick with "Best Baby Ever". Because I am.
