Today was just a regular Saturday. Mommy and I ran errands. One was to apply for my passport. Exciting!

We went to Baby Lab at Gymboree later in the afternoon. We sat down at the beginning of class. There was almost no one there. It was just George and me!

Mommy and I sat down. I tried to sit upright but I fell forward after a while and ended up on my belly. It wasn’t as bad as it usually was. _(I hated tummy time at first, but now it’s alright. Sometimes I even like it!_ All of a sudden, I was on my back!

I was stunned. Mommy was stunned. She was actually speechless for a while. _(Shocking!_

That was the first time I rolled over!!

Mommy got really excited (after the initial shock). I rolled over again. Sadly, Mommy wasn’t near her phone, so there is no video, but we both will remember this for a long time.

Watch out world!
