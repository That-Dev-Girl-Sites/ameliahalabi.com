It's happening! It's happening! It's happening!

Today was the day of my _first_ birthday party! Mommy threw my party at home and so many people came to celebrate - Teta, Uncle Yusef, Aunt Stef, Aunt Sonya and Uncle Michael and the boys, Uncle Micah, Aunt Caroline, Aunt Corey, Uncle Romel, Aunt Annie, Aunt Gussie, Aunt Lisa, Aunt Charmaine, Uncle Dave. This party was so big!

Everyone came over around 1:00. There was so much food. I played with people for a little while, but then I got really sleepy, so Mommy took me upstairs for a nap.

I only napped for a little while and, when I came back downstairs, it was time for my birthday cake! Mommy got a big sheet cake that said "Happy 1st birthday Amelia", but I also had my very own little cake that was just for me. It was chocolate with white icing and pink and purple all over it, with a purple 1 on top.

Everyone sang "Happy Birthday" to me. Mommy helped me blow out the candle. And then I could start eating the cake. I wasn't too sure about it at first. I just put a finger in the icing in the beginning. And then, I realized just how _delicious_ icing is! I kept eating and eating and eating the icing. I mean, who cares about the cake when there's _icing_!!

By the end, I had purple icing _all over_ me. Worth it. After Mommy cleaned me up, I played with everyone a bit more and then I got to open presents. I got so many toys and books and clothes. But, my favorite part about opening presents was the wrapping paper. It's so much fun!

I had a really great time at my birthday party. I can't wait to have another one next year!
