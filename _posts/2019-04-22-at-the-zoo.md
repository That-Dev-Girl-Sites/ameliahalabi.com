Mommy and I are in Binghamton with Grandpa now. We went to the zoo today. (Yes, Binghamton has a zoo!) We walked all over and saw red pandas and monkeys and big cats and penguins and wallabies.

We even stopped at the snack shack for my very first official 3:00pm ice cream. I had chocolate. I love chocolate.
