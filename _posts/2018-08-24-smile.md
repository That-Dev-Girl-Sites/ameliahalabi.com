I was super awake for a good chunk of the afternoon today. Mommy and I played for a while on my activity mat. I did tummy time for a little while, which I hated! /(I’ve never liked tummy time.)/

In order to cheer me up, Mommy started throwing me up into the air and yelling /“Wheeeee!”/ Well, she didn’t throw me, technically, since she never let go of me. But it was still a lot of fun. So much fun, that I couldn’t help but to put a great big smile on my face. My first real smile, in fact. This made mommy /so/ excited that she kept throwing me up into the air. She also went a little photo crazy. Did I mention she was /really/ excited about my smile?

The photo of my first smile is blurry, which made Mommy a little sad, but it’s ok because I still look amazing and happy in it.
