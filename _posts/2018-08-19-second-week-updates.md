It has been such a busy week, I forgot to write about it until just now. Here are some updates about my big, big week!

## Two-week check in
I had my 2-week check in with the doctor on Thursday. It went really well! The doctor was very happy because I gained a whole pound since my last check up last week, so I am now 7 lb 5 oz. This means that mommy does not need to wake me up every 3 hours to eat again.

Neither one of us liked waking up that often, especially in the middle of the night, so we are both very, very happy now (even though I still wake up on my own every 3 hours or so).

## Meeting the family
On Friday, Mommy’s cousin Jerry and his son Logan came by for a visit. They were driving from North Carolina back to New Jersey, so I got a chance to meet them! Actually, I slept through most of their visit, but I did wake up in time to say goodbye! But that’s ok - we will see them again in November for Thanksgiving.

## Exploring the neighborhood
The weather finally cooled down a little bit… sort of. We went for a walk around the neighborhood on Tuesday morning, but it was so humid and gross, that I just took a nap.

We went out for another walk this morning. It was still humid and kind of hot, but not as bad as it was on Tuesday. We walked for about 45 minutes through our neighborhood and the neighborhood next to ours. We saw a few people out an about - including a 2 year old named Eli. I did not say hi to him, though, because I was asleep.

I slept through most of today’s walk, but not all of it. Mommy was talking the entire time - about the houses and trees we passed.

## Out to dinner
Yesterday, I also went to my first restaurant ever. We went to one of Mommy’s favorite places - Fiona’s. She kept talking about curry fries. I don’t know what they are yet, but she seems very obsessed with them.

I even ate dinner at the table! Ok, I only ate formula. The restaurant was nice and quiet and I enjoyed my dinner very much. (I let Mommy finish her dinner first. I think she was happy about that.)
