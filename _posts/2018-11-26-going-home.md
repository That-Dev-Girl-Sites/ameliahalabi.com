Our trip to New Jersey has come to an end, and Mommy and I drove back home today. I slept for most of the trip home, but we did make one stop in the middle to eat and rest.

Mommy bought a chocolate croissant. The chocolate was really gooey so she put some on her finger for me to try.

*Oh. My. Goodness.*

That was life changing. I mean, I have not been alive for all that long and I see new things every day, but… wow! I *love* chocolate! I grabbed  Mommy’s finger and I never wanted to let go.

I have a new favorite food now.
