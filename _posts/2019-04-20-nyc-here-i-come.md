I went to New York City for the first time ever today! Mommy, Teta, and I drove to Long Island City to visit Aunt Nadine and Uncle Derrek. I got to play with my cousin Mason and I met my cousin Maya for the first time! I even got my first Easter basket today. I love my new bunny ears and egg shakers.
