Well, it was bound to happen sometime. Yesterday, I was sent home from day care with my first official cold. I had a fever of 103 last night, but Mommy gave my Tylonol and I felt much better after that. Though, I was still coughing and my nose was still running. All. The. Time.

I am feeling better today, but Mommy is also getting sick now. I guess they call it the "common" cold for good reason!
