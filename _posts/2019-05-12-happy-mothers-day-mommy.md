*Happy Mother's Day, Mommy!*

Today is Mommy's first Mother's Day. I gave her a present, which was a onesie that said "Happy Mother's Day! Love, Amelia". 

In the afternoon, we met with a bunch of Mommy's friends and made pancakes. I even had pancakes! They were yummy. I was not super impressed with the syrup though. We spent a lot of time at pancake brunch. I was sitting and watching Jacob and Marcus run around all over. Everyone else was talking. I got tired and took a nap in my car seat. After my nap, though, I tried to eat Cheerios, but something went wrong and I threw up _everywhere_. That was not fun. I was OK though and wanted more food pretty soon after that. After all, my tummy was empty, all of a sudden!

Mommy and I went home a little bit after that. I was feeling OK, but I felt really hot and had a fever. Mommy gave me medicine and a bottle, and by the time I was done eating, it was time for bed.

I guess today was not the calmest Mother's Day, but I still love my mommy, even if I did throw up all over her. Oops. Sorry, Mommy!
