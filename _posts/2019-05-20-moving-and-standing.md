After school today, Mommy and I did not go for a walk, so I got to play in the living room for a while before bed. I keep trying to crawl, but it doesn't always go to plan. I keep moving backwards! I don't know how, but it happens!

Also, I really wanted to stand up today and, with only a little bit of Mommy's help, I did! Mommy kept a hand on me just for balance, but I was standing all on my own otherwise!
