Happy 7-month birthday to me! I feel like my 1-year birthday is in sight, but Mommy doesn't want the time to go by quite _that_ quickly.

We did not do anything super special today because Mommy still had to go to work, but she took the usual month-birthday photos of me. But today's were special because this was the first month I could sit up through the entire photo shoot.

I do have to say... that 7-month sign was very yummy.
