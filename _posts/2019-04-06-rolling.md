I have been rolling a little for a while now. Front to back. Back to front.  During diaper changes. In my crib.

But today, I discovered something really, really fun. I can roll and roll and roll all the way across the living room! I rolled all the way from the couch to the bookshelves!

Mommy is definitely in trouble now!
