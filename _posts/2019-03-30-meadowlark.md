Today was such a fun day! It was really nice outside, that Mommy and I went to a place called Meadowlark Botanical Gardens. We met Sonya and Michael and Jacob and Marcus and Yusef there. We all walked around. It was very sunny and hot - so hot that I drank all of my water! I don't even really like water, but I drank it!
