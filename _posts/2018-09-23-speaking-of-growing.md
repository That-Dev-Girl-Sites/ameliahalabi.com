Well, it finally happened. I have been eating and eating and eating like crazy and I am now, officially, wearing my 3-6 month clothes!

Mommy finally realized it was time to size up when she put me in my footed pajamas last night and my toes were stretching against the footie part of the pjs.

Weâ€™ll miss the cute, tiny onesies, but I am really excited to get a whole new wardrobe. _(Mommy promised that she would keep the onesie that she brought me home from the hospital in. That one is special.)_
