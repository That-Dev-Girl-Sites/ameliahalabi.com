I just came back from my _first vacation_! Mommy and I went to Chicago for a long weekend to visit some of her cousins and it was so much fun!

## Friday: My first flight!

We left on Friday for my **first flight ever!** Mommy and I got to the airport early and, after going through security, we stopped for lunch. I tried some of her chicken, but did not really like it. Too bland for me! After a bit of a flight delay, we were on our way! I pretty much fell asleep as soon as we got on the plane and slept through most of the flight. It was a great nap! I woke up just in time for landing. Landing wasn't that bad.

After we got our luggage and rented a car _(which took forever, but that was another story)_ we were _finally_ on our way to Aunt Dina's house! We got to her house just in time for a late dinner, but first, I got to meet everyone. There were _so many_ people, and that is just part of Mommy's family. I got to meet Aunt Dina, Uncle Andy, my cousin Lucas, Aunt Mona, Uncle Ben, and Auntie Ghada. Teta was there too! She flew in from New Jersey.

## Saturday: Hanging out at home.

We spent Saturday hanging out at Aunt Dina's house. I mostly played and ate and napped. Just like home! It was so hot, that in the afternoon, I went into the pool with Mommy and Lucas! There was a big inflatable pool in the backyard. I had a lot of fun sitting with Mommy and splashing around.

## Sunday: Surprise!

Sunday, we all went out to a strip mall nearby for a little while. We went into Victoria's Secret for something for Auntie Ghada's sister, Suzanne. That store was way too adult for my, so after a few minute, I hung out with Teta outside. We all then went to Barnes & Noble, which is the "danger zone" for Mommy. We all spent a lot of time looking at books when it started **pouring** outside. I mean, you couldn't even see out the store windows. The lights in the store went off and back on a few times.

We waiting until the rain let up at least a little bit and then ran to the cars to go home. Aunt Mona road with Mommy and me and everyone else was in Aunt Dina's car. We had to make a pit stop on the way back to Aunt Dina's house to check on Aunt Mona's house because of the storm.

When we got back to Aunt Dina's house, the entire dining room was decorated for **a birthday party for me!!!** Because I won't see any of them on my actual birthday next month, they threw me a party. There was cake and presents. Everyone sang "Happy Birthday" to me and I got my own _giant_ cupcake with a yellow frosting flower. I _loved_ the frosting. I couldn't get enough. Even after Mommy flipped the cupcake upside-down to try to get me to eat the cake part, I figured out out to grab the bottom for _more frosting_! Yummy. :)

## Monday: Heading home

We flew back home today. Mommy, Teta, and I all drove to the airport together because our flight and Teta's flight were leaving around the same time. After we got through security, we all had lunch and then got on the plane. This time, I was awake for take off, but I was super hungry, so I ate _again_ on the plane just before take off. I fell asleep a little while after we were in the air and woke up just as we were landing. I like these in-the-air naps.
