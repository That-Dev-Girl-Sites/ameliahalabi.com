I just came back from my _first vacation_! Mommy and I went to Chicago for a long weekend to visit some of her cousins and it was so much fun!

## Friday: My first flight!

We left on Friday for my **first flight ever!** Mommy and I got to the airport early and, after going through security, we stopped for lunch. I tried some of her chicken, but did not really like it. Too bland for me! After a bit of a flight delay, we were on our way! I pretty much fell asleep as soon as we got on the plane and slept through most of the flight. It was a great nap! I woke up just in time for landing. Landing wasn't that bad.

After we got our luggage and rented a car _(which took forever, but that was another story)_ we were _finally_ on our way to Aunt Dina's house! We got to her house just in time for a late dinner, but first, I got to meet everyone. There were _so many_ people, and that is just part of Mommy's family. I got to meet Aunt Dina, Uncle Andy, my cousin Lucas, Aunt Mona, Uncle Ben, and Auntie Ghada. Teta was there too! She flew in from New Jersey.

## Saturday: Hanging out at home.

We spent Saturday hanging out at Aunt Dina's house.
