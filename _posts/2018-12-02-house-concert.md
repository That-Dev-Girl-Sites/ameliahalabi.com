Mommy sure does love concerts.  I went to my third concert today. Mommy’s friend Dan played at her other friend’s Sara and Roy’s house. So, this is another first - my first house concert!

I really love music and I had a lot of fun, but it was very loud. I’m sure glad Mommy brought my noise blocking ear muffs!
