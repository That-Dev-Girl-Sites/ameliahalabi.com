Today is the day I was born!

I was born in Alexandria, Virginia, at 1:40 pm. I was 21 inches long and weighed 6 lb and 14 oz. I had gray eyes and a full head of straight brown hair. Mommy tells me that everyone in our family is born with lots of hair, so I fit right in!

Mommy had to have a cesarean section to give birth to me, so I didn’t see her right away. After the doctors took me out of Mommy’s belly, they gave me to the nurses. They weighed and measured me, and then they cleaned me off and took my footprints for a card they gave to Mommy later.

There was music playing in the operating room when I was born. Mommy says it was a song by Norah Jones, but she doesn’t know which song it was.

Teta was the first to hold me, but the. When the doctors were all done with Mommy, they gave me to her. Mommy held me for a long time, even though she wasn’t feeling too well. I was laying in her stomach in the recovery and felt warm and loved.
