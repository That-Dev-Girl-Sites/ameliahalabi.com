Miss T has been teaching me how to hold my bottle. That was ok... But this morning Mommy wasnâ€™t feeding me fast enough so I decided to take matters into my own hands and I took the bottle myself. It worked... mostly.

I finished my bottle all by myself. I also learned that I really like holding - and chewing on - my bottle.
