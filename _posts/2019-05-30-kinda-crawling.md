I gave Mommy an early birthday present today. I kind of crawled _(just a little bit)_ forward. I was crying the _entire_ time - I mean, _all_ I wanted was the bottle and it kept moving further and further away! But... I _did_ crawl, even if it was just an inch or two and I was still on my belly (so it was more like an army crawl).

I'm not really crawling yet. When I get frustrated of _everyone_ trying to get me to crawl, I just roll into a corner and cry. But, it's a start?
