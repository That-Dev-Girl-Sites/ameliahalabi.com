Today, Mommy and I went for a walk around the neighborhood and we visited the playground. Our playground has a jungle gym and a swing set, and one of the swings is just for babies. Mommy put me in the baby swing and I have only one thing to say:

***Wheeeeeeee!!***

That was So. Much. Fun!! I want to do this every day!
