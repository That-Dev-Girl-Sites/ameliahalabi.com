Mommy really wanted to go to work today to have Indian food with her coworkers today, but I was still sick, so we stayed home. But... Mommy decided to order Indian food for lunch for the _both of us!_

She would not let me try the samosas _(too spicy)_, but I did try the vegetable korma. That was _delicious_! I wanted to eat the entire thing.

In other news, I discovered today just how much fun boxes are.
