**I'm crawling!!** I'm crawling! I'm crawling! I'm crawling! I'm crawling!

Did I mention that I'm crawling?

I mean, I am only crawling a little bit, just far enough _(a couple of inches)_ to reach the closest toy. But, I got up on my hands and knees and _crawled_ there!

Mommy and I are both very excited about this. Well, her more so than me. Crawling is way more work than just being handed a toy!
