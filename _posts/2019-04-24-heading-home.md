Our vacation is over and Mommy and I are driving back home today. It is a long, long, _long_ drive home. We left really early in the morning, right after only one breakfast!

We stopped along the way for second breakfast and then drove straight to Gettysburg for what Mommy was calling a "special surprise." We stopped for lunch at Friendly's, which Mommy _loves_! We both ate lunch there and then Mommy ordered... and ice cream sundae! It was so big. It had ice cream and chocolate _and_ whipped cream! Mommy wanted to take a picture of all of us, but I couldn't wait. I grabbed a big chunk of whipped cream with my hand. Yum, yum, yum!!

I love surprises, especially that one.
