It is time. Mommy says that the swing at home that I love so much has to go. I outgrew that swing so much that my feet hang off the edge!

We are giving it away to another family with a smaller baby than me. I swung on this swing one last time today, just for old time's sake. I will miss it, but that's ok. The playground swing is so much better anyway.

In better news, I went to my first music class at Gymboree today! It was so much fun. I got to bang on the drum and play with shakers and sing and dance and throw balls around. But, I mostly love singing. Or, well, shouting to the music.
