Happy Halloween from Amelia Earhart and Fred Noonan!

Alsoâ€¦ Happy 3-month Birthday to me!!

Mommy and I tested out our costumes on Saturday at the Halloween party at Gymboree and they were a hit! We dressed up today too for the trick or treaters. Aunt Stef came over to celebrate and we handed out candy before I went to bed.
