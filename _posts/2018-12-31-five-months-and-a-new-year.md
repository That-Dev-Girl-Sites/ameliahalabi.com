Today is such a big dayâ€¦ happy 5-month birthday to me!

Mommy and I are back from New Jersey. I went to back to day care today, after celebrating my birthday.

Today is also the last day of the year of my birth. Happy new year everyone! I hope next year will be even more fun and exciting as this year was.
