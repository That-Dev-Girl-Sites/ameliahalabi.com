It's the weekend! I am feeling _much_ better this weekend, so Mommy and I spent the whole day out. This morning, we went to a picnic all the way in MD. It was a big group of other single mommies with their kids. Most of the kids were much bigger than me, but some were also babies. I even met another baby with my name!... but she spells her name "Emelia" with an "E". We had a lot of fun at the picnic. A photographer took pictures of Mommy and me together. I got to eat pasta and banana, but I was too full to eat any dessert. It was a nice day.

After the picnic, I went to Gymboree for Baby Lab with Sam. I haven't been to Baby Lab in so long. We were early, so I got to play on my own for a little bit. I was on one of the mats and I started sliding backwards. That was fun! I really wanted to go forwards, though. Maybe some day soon.
