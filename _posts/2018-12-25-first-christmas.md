Merry First Christmas to me!

I am spending the holiday in New Jersey, just like Mommy and I did for Thanksgiving. We (with Teta) went to Uncle Jerry’s house for Christmas Eve last night. I met Santa again! He even let me sit on his lap.

I got some gifts last night, but Santa came to Teta’s house overnight and left me so many gifts! I got a xylophone and maracas and giant blocks and a stuffed elephant and bubbles! I’m going to have so much fun with all of my new toys!
