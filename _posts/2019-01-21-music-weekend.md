This was such a busy weekend! Uncle Paul and Uncle John came on Thursday to stay with us because it was a big, big weekend. This was MLK weekend, which is also the weekend Eddie From Ohio plays at the Birchmere every weekend. (I don’t really know what any of this means but Mommy is pretty into this.)

Friday night, Mommy and I went to the Birchmere to visit friends. We went back stage and I met so many people. It was busy but I loved watching everyone. We didn’t stay for the show, but...

We went to Annapolis on Saturday to visit the Amish market. Everyone was very obsessed about pretzels. I wish I could have had one. They looked yummy!

Saturday night, Mommy decided to go to the show. She left me with a babysitter. Her name was Miss Tia. My first babysitter! Ever! I wasn’t happy when I saw Mommy leaving but I had a good time with Miss Tia. I was sleeping when Mommy came home, but I was so happy to see her the next morning.

Sunday we took a road trip to a diner in Maryland to surprise Aunt Gussie and Aunt Charmaine. Aunt Lisa organized all of us to go to brunch together. It was a great surprise! I sat in a high chair for the first time. (Kind of. I was in my car seat, but on top of a high chair.) I tried mashed potatoes too. They were ok, I guess.

Sunday night, we went back to the Birchmere and we spent more time back stage. Mommy wanted to listen to the opening band that night, but I wasn't too happy about staying up past my bedtime. We went home right after they finished playing. They were good, but I need my cutie sleep!
