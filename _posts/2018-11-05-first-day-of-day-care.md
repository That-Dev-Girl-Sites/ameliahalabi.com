Today was my first day of day care.  I only spent a few hours at day care today, just to get used to it, but it was an exciting first day!

I met all the teachers and other babies. I ate. I napped. I played with ice cubes. I cried a little. _(It’s so noisy there!)_ Mommy cried a little. _(She missed me.)_ But we’ll both get used to it.
