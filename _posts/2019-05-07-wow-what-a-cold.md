I was sick for almost a week with a really bad cold. I don't like being sick. _Waaahh!_

I started coughing a little bit last Tuesday. The nurse that Mommy spoke to said it was probably just teething and post-nasal drip, but I felt much worse on Thursday.

Mommy took me to see the doctor on Friday. She was really nice and looked at all my parts. She gave me something called a breathing treatment, which meant I had to wear a mask and breathe in this mist for 10 minutes. I did not like that one bit, but I could breathe a whole lot better when it was done. I stayed home from school on Friday.

The doctor gave Mommy the breathing treatment machine and I had to use it a few more times between Friday and Saturday. By Saturday, I was feeling much better. We went back to see the doctor and she said I looked really good too. Yay! Mommy and I went to lunch with Dave, Naomi, and Ness that afternoon.

But, Sunday morning, I was not happy. Not one bit. By that afternoon, I had a fever. Mommy gave me medicine that made me feel better.

I stayed home from school again on Monday, which was probably a good thing because I got _another_ fever. _Waaahh!_

This morning I went to see the doctor again. I had a regular check up anyway but we mostly talked about this cold. I am feeling much better now and the doctor said I should be able to go back to school as soon as I am fever-free for a whole day. (I stayed home from school again today, too.)

Guess what. I did not get a fever today! I am so glad to be feeling better now and can't wait to go back to school tomorrow. Yay!
