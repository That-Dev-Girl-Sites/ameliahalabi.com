Yesterday, I went in for my 6-month checkup. I grew! (No surprise there.) I did not grow a whole lot, but I am bigger than I was before and the doctor is OK with that.

I also got more vaccines. There were 3 needles this time. **Waaaaaah!!**

What was even worse is that I got my very first fever last night. My temperature starting going up and up and up. It went so high, Miss T had to send me home from day care. Mommy was worried - especially when it went up to 103 - but the nurse on the phone said it was fine. It was probably from those vaccines and my fever would come down soon.

In the meantime, I got to be **naked baby!!**

My fever did come down today, but I had to stay home from day care anyway. Mommy and I spent the whole day together, mostly snuggling (and being naked!).
